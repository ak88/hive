## Test Cases

### Deneb Builder Builds Block With Invalid Payload Version

#### Run

<details>
<summary>Command-line</summary>

```bash
./hive --client <CLIENTS> --sim eth2/dencun --sim.limit "eth2-deneb-builder/test-builders-invalid-payload-version-"
```

</details>

#### Description


Test consensus clients correctly reject a built payload if the
version is outdated (capella instead of deneb).

#### Testnet Configuration


- Node Count: 2
- Validating Node Count: 2
- Validator Key Count: 128
- Validator Key per Node: 64- Genesis Fork: Capella
- Execution Withdrawal Credentials Count: 128
- BLS Withdrawal Credentials Count: 0
- Deneb/Cancun transition occurs on Epoch 1 or 5
	- Epoch depends on whether builder workflow activation requires finalization [on the CL client](#clients-that-require-finalization-to-enable-builder).
- Builder is enabled for all nodes
- Nodes have the mock-builder configured as builder endpoint

#### Verifications (Execution Client)


- Blob (type-3) transactions are included in the blocks

#### Verifications (Consensus Client)


- For each blob transaction on the execution chain, the blob sidecars are available for the beacon block at the same height
- The beacon block lists the correct commitments for each blob
- After all other verifications are done, the beacon chain is able to finalize the current epoch
- Verify that the builder, up to before Deneb fork, has been able to produce blocks and they have been included in the canonical chain
- After Deneb fork, the builder must be able to include blocks with blobs in the canonical chain, which implicitly verifies:
	- Consensus client is able to properly format header requests to the builder
	- Consensus client is able to properly format blinded signed requests to the builder
	- No signed block contained an invalid format or signature
- There are no more than 1 missed slots on the latest epoch

### Deneb Builder Builds Block With Invalid Beacon Root, Incorrect State Root

#### Run

<details>
<summary>Command-line</summary>

```bash
./hive --client <CLIENTS> --sim eth2/dencun --sim.limit "eth2-deneb-builder/test-builders-invalid-payload-beacon-root-"
```

</details>

#### Description


Test consensus clients correctly circuit break builder after a
period of empty blocks due to invalid unblinded blocks.

The payloads are built using an invalid parent beacon block root, which can only
be caught after unblinding the entire payload and running it in the
local execution client, at which point another payload cannot be
produced locally and results in an empty slot.

#### Testnet Configuration


- Node Count: 2
- Validating Node Count: 2
- Validator Key Count: 128
- Validator Key per Node: 64- Genesis Fork: Capella
- Execution Withdrawal Credentials Count: 128

- Deneb/Cancun transition occurs on Epoch 1 or 5
	- Epoch depends on whether builder workflow activation requires finalization [on the CL client](#clients-that-require-finalization-to-enable-builder).
- Builder is enabled for all nodes
- Nodes have the mock-builder configured as builder endpoint

#### Verifications (Execution Client)


- Blob (type-3) transactions are included in the blocks

#### Verifications (Consensus Client)


- For each blob transaction on the execution chain, the blob sidecars are available for the beacon block at the same height
- The beacon block lists the correct commitments for each blob
- After all other verifications are done, the beacon chain is able to finalize the current epoch
- Verify that the builder, up to before Deneb fork, has been able to produce blocks and they have been included in the canonical chain
- Circuit breaker correctly kicks in and disables the builder workflow
	- Implicitly verified by missed-slot count
- Builder workflow is re-enabled after the circuit breaker timeout
- There are no more than 10 missed slots on the latest epoch
